### Graph Algorithm Visualizer
## What is this?
This project is a web app that helps visualize how different algorithms work in the context of graphs.

At a high level it supports two major capabilities:

1. Visually define and manage a graphs via an SVG.
2. Run an algorithm (from a pre-defined list) against that graph and view an animation of it's behavior.

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript (TypeScript), HTML, CSS
- Vite (package manager)
- D3 (SVG management)

## How to run.
1. Install all dependencies via `npm install`
2. Run the app (runs locally on port 3000) via `npm run dev`
