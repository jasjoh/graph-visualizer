### Dijkstta Algorithm Visualizer
## What is this?
This project is a web app that helps visualize how Dijkstra's graph pathing algorithm works. At a high level it:

1. Allows you to define a graph by creating, adding, removing and creating relationships between nodes.
2. Renders the graph using HTML native scalable vector graphics (<SVG>)
3. Visualizes how Dijkstra's algorithm paths through the graph to finding shortest distance between two nodes.
